                                <h2>Overview</h2>


                                <p> <strong> Har Ki Dun or the Valley of Gods</strong> is located in the Garhwal
                                    Himalayas of
                                    the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand. At 3,500 M, Har Ki Dun is one of the
                                    most gorgeous river valley treks in the country. Diverse flora and fauna,
                                    larger than life landscapes, quaint villages tucked into the mountains and
                                    vast, expansive meadows leave you in awe throughout. The trek
                                    progresses alongside the splendid Supin River, crossing bridges across
                                    clear water streams running through scenic Garhwali.
                                <p>The Har Ki Dun trail is famous for its changing scenery in each season.
                                    During summer and spring, pleasant temperatures grace the valley.
                                    Flowers are in full bloom and there is a delightful range of wildlife to spot.
                                    With the onset of winters, the valley experiences snowfall every couple of
                                    weeks transforming the lush green highlights into pristine whites.</p>

                                <p>The Har Ki Dun summit is a treat to behold. On a clear day, you can spot
                                    the snow-capped Swargarohini Peak, Hata Peak and Black Peak amongst
                                    others. This moderate level trek has various facets to take pleasure in,
                                    such as the alpine flowers, open meadows, dense coniferous forests and
                                    views of colossal mountain ranges making it a complete package.
                                    Spanning over 67 km, the trek begins from the quaint village of Sankri in
                                    Uttarakhand. We will cover the journey till Taluka on a motorable road. The
                                    trek from Taluka till Puani Garaat runs along the waters of the Supin River.
                                    You will be walking under a canopy of Walnut, Pine and Cedar trees
                                    opening up to vast fields of potato and maize on the way. The Puani
                                    Garaat Campsite is a little farther ahead, situated in a lovely clearing on
                                    the banks of the Supin River.</p>
                                <p>The following day, the trek gradient is steeper as we head towards
                                    Kalkattiyadhaar located 8 km away. The trail runs through dense Oak
                                    forests and fertile Amaranth farms with the Supin River accompanying you
                                    throughout. Look out for sections that make up for some brilliant vantage
                                    points offering magnificent views of the Bandarpoonch and Swargarohini
                                    ranges along the way. A four hour hike will bring you to the
                                    Kalkattiyadhaar campsite which is a vast open meadow cradled in a valley
                                    surrounded by pine and oak trees.</p>

                                <p>The next day, we will be ascending to the summit from the Kalkattiyadhaar
                                    campsite. Be prepared for an early start as we will need to cover 14 km.
                                    The trek gradient for the day is moderate with gradual ascents and
                                    descents. The trail climbs higher up through a thicket of forests before
                                    culminating in the grand Har Ki Dun summit. Spot the Swargarohini peak,
                                    Hata Peak and Black Peak covered in snow from here. Given its beauty
                                    and moderate difficulty level, this trek is ideal for beginners looking to step
                                    up their trekking game in the Himalayas.</p>

                                <p> The best time to do Har Ki Dun Trek is from September till December. Stay

                                            <li>The journey begins from the capital city of Dehradun. If you have opted for
                                                transportation by Bikat Adventures, please ensure you board your vehicle
                                                from ISBT Dehradun latest by 7 AM. If you are travelling on your own to
                                                Sankri, this could come in handy in planning your trip. </li>
                                            <li>Sankri is located at a distance of 197 km from Dehradun and would take
                                                about 9-10 hours to cover, gaining an altitude of 1950 m. The drive will take
                                                you through the spectacular hills of Mussoorie and the renowned Kempty
                                                falls. The roads here are long and winding and swift mountain streams run
                                                parallel to the roads in many sections..</li>
                                            <li> After crossing Mussoorie, the landscape changes distinctly. Deep gorges are
                                                replaced by a canopy of blue pine forests that carry the fresh scent of the
                                                woods. The Yamuna River accompanies you constantly throughout..</li>
                                            <li>The final stretch of 22 km to Sankri, however, steals the show as we will be
                                                driving through the infamous Govind National Park that is home to a plethora
                                                of exotic flora and fauna. The roads can be rough and bumpy in some
                                                sections but the breathtaking views of the dense conifer forests, Tons river
                                                valley and scattered apple orchids will more than make up for it..</li>
                                            <li>Expect to reach Sankri by 5 PM in the evening. Sankri is a lush green village
                                                that hosts some unparalleled views of Mt. Swargarohini, especially during
                                                sunset time. During the peak winter season, that is December to February,
                                                you will encounter snow right from Sankri itself. The stay today will be in

                                                Taluka. We start at 8 AM and drive through a forest road flanked by Deodar
                                                and Bamboo trees. Streams of clear water swerving down the hills
                                                accompany you throughout this stretch. The drive is a delight for all nature
                                                lovers as you will be able to spot rare Himalayan birds like the Himalayan

                                            <li>It takes an hour to reach Taluka. Taluka is a small picturesque hamlet with a
                                                cluster of concrete houses and a couple of government guest houses. The
                                                gushing Supin River flowing across the village dominates the landscape..</li>
                                            <li>After a short break of refreshments, we begin the 9 km trek towards Pauni
                                                Garaat. The trek commences on an uneven stony trail that runs out of the
                                                village. A few minutes into the trek, the trail expands into open land and you
                                                will find yourself walking along the banks of the Supin River..</li>
                                            <li>Eventually, the trail translates into a level walk through dense lush conifers
                                                where you spot the first cemented bridge running over a small gentle
                                                stream. After about 20 minutes, you will come across another wooden
                                                bridge over a stream. You can fill your water bottles here..</li>
                                            <li>The hike is quite pleasant throughout as you will be walking under the shade
                                                of Walnut, Pine and Cedar trees accompanied by the sound of the flowing
                                                river. You might even find walnuts on the ground in autumn. The gradient of
                                                the trail is easy mostly with gradual ascents. You will often see mule-traffic
                                                along the way accompanied by locals carrying heavy loads on their backs in
                                                preparation for the long winters..</li>
                                            <li> A couple of hours into the trek, you will see the small village of Gangar on
                                                the other side of the river. Small wooden shops serving tea and snacks dot
                                                the landscape. We will be taking a quick halt here to have our packed
                                                lunches..</li>
                                            <li>The trail out of the Gangar village runs along the right hand side of the river.
                                                Fields of Potato and Maize can be spotted along the way. The campsite for
                                                the day, Puani Garaat, is situated in a vast clearing enroute. The actual
                                                village of Puani Garaat, however, is located on the other side of the river..</li>
                                            <li>After setting up camps and freshening up, take some time to explore the
                                                area around the campsite. Have a hot dinner and tuck in early to get ample
                                                rest for the next day. </li>

                                                the trek ahead. Post breakfast, we commenced the 8 km long trek to
                                                Kalkattiyadhaar. The trail runs through a thicket of towering forests
                                                culminating in the village of Seema. It is marked by a sparse cluster of
                                                concrete structures and a forest department guest house set on the banks of
                                                the Supin River. The Osla village is located on the other side of the river, at a
                                                slightly higher elevation of about a hundred metres. </li>
                                            <li>Next to the village of Seema lies the infamous Seema Bridge, a large
                                                hanging bridge running across the Supin River with a backdrop of colossal
                                                mountain ranges. The jewel-blue Supin River can be seen sparkling as it
                                                winds its merry way through the boulders..</li>
                                            <li>Once you cross the bridge, get ready for a steep climb all the way up to the
                                                point where we meet the trail coming out of Osla. Expansive farms, mostly
                                                growing Amaranth, dominate the landscape here. You will find villagers
                                                working in the farms. During monsoon, the amaranth takes on a deep
                                                reddish hue adding a striking contrast to the scenery. After half an hour, the
                                                trail opens up to grand snow-capped views of the Bandarpoonch and
                                                Swargarohini ranges..</li>
                                            <li>The trail gradually climbs higher beyond this point passing by a variety of
                                                flowers like fleece and sunflowers. As we make our way past a couple of
                                                fields, the river Supin retreats from view far below. This stretch is blessed
                                                with some magnificent viewpoints of the Dhauladhar ranges..</li>
                                            <li>The trail eventually culminates at a ridge locally named as Kalkattiyadhar.
                                                Our campsite lays a short descent away from this ridge. Expect to reach the
                                                campsite by 1 PM in the afternoon..</li>
                                            <li>The KalkattiAadhar campsite is a beautiful open meadow set in an exquisite
                                                location. You will be able to spot some renowned peaks like the Buyal Devsu
                                                and Mt. Black Peak from here. You will also be able to see the Ruinsara
                                                Range running on the left and the Kedarkantha Summit on the right. Take a
                                                breather basking in the expansive views of the valley and the warm sun.
                                                This day being a short one gives ample time to the trekkers to acclimatise to

                                                microspikes and gaiters for easy navigation. </li>
                                            <li>The trail heading out of the campsite runs high above the convergence of
                                                the Supin River and the river from the Ruinsara valley. From this point
                                                onwards, sprawling views of the snow-clad peaks of Ruinsara valley
                                                (including Mt. Black peak) with the Har Ki Dun valley resting below take over
                                                the landscape. The trek gradient is moderate with a mixture of steep and
                                                gradual ascends.</li>
                                            <li>The trail eventually leads you to a stretch with an incline of about 45
                                                degrees. Although it is not steep, the section is likely to be covered in
                                                knee-deep snow making it a taxing ascent.</li>
                                            <li>The last leg to the summit climbs side by side with the river through a dense
                                                forest before opening up to a clearing cradling some of the prominent peaks
                                                in the region. This is the Har Ki Dun Summit. From the summit, you will be
                                                able to see the open grounds below Swaragrohini-1 peak and also catch
                                                glimpses of Hata Peak and Black Peak covered in snow.</li>
                                            <li> The valley has plenty to explore such as meadows full of alpine flowers,
                                                glacier moraines, coniferous forests, swift streams and the grand view of
                                                huge mountain ranges. You can explore the entire ground in about an hour
                                                or two and head back to KalkattiAadhaar after lunch.</li>

                                                double storied wooden houses with slant roofs. There is a charming

                                                talking to the locals who are always happy to see trekkers. We will then

                                                leave you with a stinging sensation for about 25 minutes. Don’t worry
                                                though, the herb is not poisonous and is in fact cooked by locals as a

    <li>Meet us at the Haridwar Railway station at 7 AM</li>
    <li>Your trek guide and fellow trekkers will assemble here</li>
    <li>It is advisable to reach Haridwar a day earlier to avoid any delays. We start the uphill
        drive to Govind Ghat via Joshimath.</li>
    <li>The drive will take up to 9-10 hours to complete. As you drive up the Bhagirath
        highway, with the Alaknanda River running alongside the way, you will start noticing
        the sharp bends in the road and the valley getting deeper and deeper.</li>
    <li>Along the way, you will be crossing Devprayag. Here, the holy conuence of the
        Bhagirathi and Alaknanda Rivers happens which forms the River Ganges.</li>
    <li>You will reach the base camp, perched at a height of 1,828 m (5,997 ft), late in the
        evening. After the long drive, rest for a while and acclimatise to the altitude. Also,
        enjoy the view of Hathi Parvat.</li>
    <li>Grab your delicious dinner before heading to your hotel/homestay for the night.</li>
    <li> <strong>Please Note: </strong> The Har ki Doon Trek will start a little beyond Joshimath at a
        pilgrim village called Govind Ghat. So leave Rishikesh in the morning and travel along
        River Alaknanda on the Badrinath Road (highway). You do not need to carry food
        items with you as there are plenty of eateries on the way. You do not need to hire
        porters or mules on this trail. However, if you need one to carry your backpack, you can
        nd one from Govindghat. BSNL is available in Govindghat. So make all your calls
        before you start the trek.</li>
