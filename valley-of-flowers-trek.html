                <h2>Overview</h2>
                

                <p> <strong> Valley of Flowers</strong> is an easy to moderate trek that oers rare access to the part of
                    Uttarakhand Himalayas which has an expanse of a valley covered with owers. It is also
                    considered an ideal trek for rst-timers, including family and kids. During the Valley of
                    Flowers trek, one also gets a chance to visit the highest Gurudwara in the world – the
                    Hemkund Sahib. <br>
                    The valley of owers is about 2 km wide and 8 km long and the best time to visit is
                    between July to mid of September. The temperature on this trek usually stays somewhere
                    between 5 to 20 degrees Celsius and you can expect moderate rainfall even while trekking
                    with a thick cloud cover hovering over most of the time. The most dicult part of the
                    Valley of Flowers trek is the climb to Hemkund Sahib on the last day, where we climb an
                    altitude of about 4,300 ft in a day and that can be a bit strenuous.<br>
                    The Valley of Flowers in Uttarakhand is extremely rich in biodiversity making it a
                    paradise for naturalists. The Valley Flowers is home to many rare species of ora and
                    fauna that add to the magnicence of the trek. The Valley of Flowers boasts an impressive
                    record of 13 species of mammals, each contributing to the region's rich wildlife. The
                    biodiverse haven of Valley of Flowers features as many as 520 varieties of plants. This trek
                    is a testament to the extraordinary biodiversity that graces the Himalayan region.</p>


                    <p> <strong><h5>Why Valley of Flowers is special:</h5></strong> Already you may be in love with the just wow photos, typically a slope of a mountain
                        covered with wild owers. You can see somewhat similar ower covered slopes or ground
                        in some other valleys on the Himalayas as well. However this valley is not special due to a
                        few varieties in abundance during monsoon. But it is the sheer variety and the amount of
                        owers together that make Valley of Flowers a unique and a must to visit place for a
                        nature lover.</p>
    
    
                        <p> <strong><h5>About Valley Of Flowers Trek:</h5></strong> A few hours of trekking would be slightly dicult, but once you reach the valley you will
                            forget about everything. Enjoy the tranquillity and the hush around the valley. Watch the
                            rise of the moon around <br>
                            Midnight, ogled at the stars shimmering millions of light-years away with your friends
                            and family by lying inside the tent. Get to see the dierent kinds of owers. This would
                            be a treat to your eyes, as you witness the dierent types of Himalayan owers. It has
                            gained so much importance and is adorned with a diversity of Alpine owers,
                            representative of the Western Himalayan Alpine shrub and meadow ecoregion. The valley
                            is also blessed with various colours of <br>
                            Flowers, taking on diverse shades of colours as time advanced. Brahma Kamal is one of the
                            most famous. Himalayan ower which can be seen in the month of July- August.</p>

        items with you as there are plenty of eateries on the way. You do not need to hire

            through the park.</li> 
        <li> After crossing the bridge, the scenery changes abruptly as the valley opens up on
            one side, revealing a stunning vista of a seemingly endless expanse of a carpet of
            owers of all colours and kinds!</li>
        <li>You can spot Geraniums, Himalayan Roses, Blue Poppy, the Dog Flower and a lot
            of other species of owers all in dierent vibrant colours - blue, red, yellow, and
            pink.</li> 
        <li>After a hot lunch, start the trek back to Ghangaria.</li>
        <li> Reach back to Ghangaria, where you can rest, have dinner and call it a day.</li> 
        <li>1. <strong> Please Note:</strong> You have to leave Ghangria at 6.00 AM so that you can spend more
            time at Valley of Flowers. The path divides in less than a kilometre. Buy entry
            tickets to the valley from the gate. Witness and notice the small owering plants
            on either side as you walk inside. As you move further, there is a scenic bridge
            across a gushing stream.</li>

    </p>
   <ul>
    <li>Trekking height is 9,600 ft to 14,107 ft and back.</li>
        <li>The trek will take around 9 to 10 hours and has a distance of 6 km each way.</li>
        <li>The trek gradient is moderate to dicult.</li>
        <li>Do not forget to carry water. You can rell your water bottles from hotels that you
            will nd on the way.</li>
        <li>On this day, rise before the sun for an early breakfast!</li>
        <li>Start with the preparation for a relatively dicult day ahead!</li>
        <li>This day, you will undertake the trek to Hemkund Sahib, perched at an altitude of
            4300 m!</li>
        <li> The trek will take a total of up to 9 hours to complete and the terrain of the trek
            remains steep throughout. Start the trek up the steep path, and you will soon come
            across a small waterfall as the vista starts improving.</li> 
        <li>As you go further up, you will start noticing the declining levels of oxygen in the
            air. Take plenty of breaks along the way to avoid altitude sickness.</li>
        <li>But the stunning vistas will be more than enough to distract you from the
            struggle.</li>
        <li>Enjoy lunch to keep yourself energized.</li>
        <li>When you nally reach the Hemkund Sahib, take in the serenity and tranquillity
            pervading the area as well as the picturesque sight of the Hemkund Sahib
            Gurudwara, alongside the lake.</li>
        <li>Here on this religious site, it is said that Guru Gobind Singh had meditated in the
            previous life.</li>
        <li>With the rare Brahma Kamal visible now and then, it is a beautiful sight to
            behold!</li>
        <li>After relaxing here for a while, and having your lunch alongside the lake, start the
            descent for Ghanghariya.</li> 
        <li>The descent will be steep and will be dicult on the knees, but it will be a
            thrilling and invigorating experience!</li>
        <li>Reach Ghangaria where you can enjoy dinner.</li>

    <li>Meet us at the Haridwar Railway station at 7 AM.</li>
    <li>Your trek guide and fellow trekkers will assemble here.</li>
    <li>It is advisable to reach Haridwar a day earlier to avoid any delays. We start the uphill
        drive to Govind Ghat via Joshimath.</li>
    <li>The drive will take up to 9-10 hours to complete. As you drive up the Bhagirath
        highway, with the Alaknanda River running alongside the way, you will start noticing
        the sharp bends in the road and the valley getting deeper and deeper.</li>
    <li>Along the way, you will be crossing Devprayag. Here, the holy conuence of the
        Bhagirathi and Alaknanda Rivers happens which forms the River Ganges.</li>
    <li>You will reach the base camp, perched at a height of 1,828 m (5,997 ft), late in the
        evening. After the long drive, rest for a while and acclimatise to the altitude. Also,
        enjoy the view of Hathi Parvat.</li>
    <li>Grab your delicious dinner before heading to your hotel/homestay for the night.</li>
    <li> <strong>Please Note: </strong> The Valley of Flowers trek will start a little beyond Joshimath at a
        pilgrim village called Govind Ghat. So leave Rishikesh in the morning and travel along
        River Alaknanda on the Badrinath Road (highway). You do not need to carry food
        items with you as there are plenty of eateries on the way. You do not need to hire
        porters or mules on this trail. However, if you need one to carry your backpack, you can
        nd one from Govindghat. BSNL is available in Govindghat. So make all your calls
        before you start the trek.</li>
