                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Hikers think that when it comes to great summer hikes, hikes like Rupin Pass or Buran Ghati can't be missed. And when we talk about Har-Ki-Dun, they think he's a poor cousin. It's not correct at all. Har Ki Dun must be one of the most adventurous trips in our country. The Garhwal Mountains have spectacular formations and diverse geographical areas. Clear rivers formed by melting glaciers, lush grasslands, villages, pine forests, and rugged terrain make up the region's diverse topography. But perhaps it is the mythical aspect of the Har-Ki-Dun trip that makes this arduous journey all the more special. Due to its isolation, the area is a paradise for bird watchers and nature lovers. It will be a wonderful experience to walk along the "Valley of the Gods" and follow the path once traversed by the Pandavas on their way to paradise through Swargarohini, the mountain that dominates the Har-Ki-Dun valley. Yamuna's main source is the largest tributary of the Tons River. Note, Har Ki Dun and Ruinsara Nallah from the bend of the Tamosa River, near the village of Osla. Tamosa flows beside Taluka and below the village, Sankri merges with Supin near Jakhol. Supin and Rupin combine with Netwar to form the Tons River.</p>
                <p> <strong> Best Time to Visit:</strong>  Whole is the best to visit Har Ki Dun. But, the Best time to visit Har-Ki-Dun is in summers (April-June) and winters (October-December). If you wanna enjoy the snow in Har-Ki-Dun. You should come har ki dun in January to March.</p>

                  <h4>Day 2: Drive from Sankri to Taluka (2,424m.). Trek from Taluka to Puani Garaat (2,523m.)</h4>
                  <p>The trek starts from Taluka, then walks 10 km to Puani Garaat, which takes about 6 hours to get there. After your first hike in a valley along the Supin River, you follow a path interspersed with forests and bridges. No music can come close to what is at stake here. Another hour's walk and you reach the bridge over a tributary of the Supin River. You will find a campsite by crossing this bridge. After climbing, walking, and crossing some more bridges, you will arrive at Gangaad is a village with little population. Lush green vegetation, wild orchids, and majestic views of dramatic mountain peaks will enhance the beauty and ease this arduous trek. Overnight at Puani Garaat.</p>

                  <h4>Day 3:  Day 3: Puani Garaat (2,523m.) to Kalkatiyadhaar (2,729m. appx)
</h4>
                  <p>The day begins with a short trek along the river that takes you to Osla, a small village of about 2,590m. above sea level; this village has a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. The architecture of this temple is a miracle in itself. You may spend some time here and explore the village before moving on. There is one STD also in Osla but phone connectivity depends entirely on the weather. As you begin your trek from Osla, you would find steep terrain as well as level grounds. You’d have crossed two streams, with the second one having a wooden bridge for trekkers to walk over it. Subsequently, as you proceed ahead of a mountain bend, a series of grasslands would follow. Some of these have been used for cultivation at some point in time. With the incline increasing gradually, you would find several huge boulders and tracts of grass. After crossing two more meadows, just below the valley over Supin, you’ll find a wooden bridge that leads you to the grasslands of Dev Thach, Bali Pass, and Ruinsara River. Walking past the wheat fields, you move to the inhabited areas as your trail ascends over the confluence of Ruinsara and Supin. From this vantage point, you will see the majestic views of Black Peak and Bandarpoonch. By the evening, you would reach your campsite Kalkatiyadhaar which takes about 6 hours</p>

                  <h4>Day 4: Kalkatiyadhaar (2,729m.) to Har-Ki-dun (3,586m.) and back to Kalkatiyadhaar.</h4>
                  <p>The trek from Kalkatiyadhaar to Har-ki-Dun is 5 Km where you’d gain an elevation of 857m. On your right, you come across the pastures of Dev Thach, just where the two rivers meet. From this point, the valley bifurcates into two, with Har-Ki-Dun on the left and Ruinsara Taal, Bali Pass on the right. On your way, you could now have a glance at the peak of Har-Ki-Dun and Hata Peak. The grasslands and pine forests would give way to a small waterfall, and from here, a steep climb for minutes would lead you to level land, with patches of snow becoming more and more prominent all along your path. Some more climbing would take you to a forest stretch with a gradual incline. Once you reach Har-Ki-Dun after crossing a wooden bridge, you’d see the valley divided into two by a rivulet. The valley towards your left is going to Maninda Taal and Borasu Pass and the other; to Jaundar Glacier. This would include the proximate views of Swargarohini peaks and the Jaundar Glacier. After spending some time at Har Ki Dun, we will return to Kalkatiyadhaar camp.</p>

                  <p>Trekking back to the village Puani Garaat would pass through Osla, this downhill trek would involve descending about 1,066m. in 5 hours. Wake up comfortably as the day is easy and start your 7 km of the trek after having breakfast. The mesmerizing beauty of the Himalayas would always be encouraging and you would find several vantage points to capture the eternal charm of the snow-clad peaks.

                  <p>Today, you will reach Taluka from the starting place of about 10 km, about 5 hours. The trail is all along the river. Follow a path interspersed with forests and bridges. Getting back to Taluka is easy with regular paths. After arriving in Taluka, proceed to Sankri, and check-in for one night at the guesthouse/camp/homestay. Wandering around this quiet village and learning a few words of the local language is much appreciated, and often helps make the most of the experience..</p>
