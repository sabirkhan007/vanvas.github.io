                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Bali Pass a not so popular trek. Surprisingly, it goes along the famous places of the Himalayas. The
                  first one being Yamunotri, the Dhaam of the Chaar Dhaam yatra. Followed by it is Har ki Doon valley
                  then Ruinsara lake and Osla village. Known for direct spectacles of Swargrohini and Bandarpoonch
                  peaks, this trek is literally a stairway to heaven. Not many know that this pass connects Har ki Doon
                  and Ruinsara valley. As high as 16,207 ft this pass is a difficult trek offering the raw adventures.
                  Not only that summit itself is small that can fit only 20-30 people. The pass offers a 360-degree view
                  of Swargarohini, Banderpooch and Garhwal peaks.</p>

                <p>Through this trek, one gets to relish the adventurous part of the religious Yamunotri valley. The path
                  goes through villages that emits extravaganze of old village life. The genuiune beauty of Osla and
                  Ghangad villages gives an insight into ancient yet modern Himalayan lifestyle. Then comes Debshu
                  Bugyal. Just like any alpine meadows, this enhances the beauty of the Bali pass trek. It also
                  completes the trek in all terms. Ruinsara Tal is the cherry on the cake of this trek. It is a
                  magnifying source of beauty that reflects everything around it with a filter of magnificence. The
                  climax is the summit climb to Bali pass which is always snow-packed making no closer to a cake-walk.
                  If ascend is not enough, the descend will blow your mind and satisfy your every crazy nerve.</p>

                <p>Bali pass trek is for those who wish to hike to different and less travelled paths. Even though it is
                  difficult it’s every step is worth it. It challenges us in every way through drastically changing
                  terrians, narrow paths, dangerous descend, long hours of walking. Of historic, religious,
                  mountaineering, importance Bali pass trek is nothing like any other Himalayan trek. It is a walk into
                  the unknown of the known.</p>

                      <h4>Day 1: Dehradun to Sankri</h4>
                      <p>
                        The first stop before Bali pass trek begins is the base village Sankri. It is a small hamlet of
                        Uttarkashi that lies in Govind Wildlife Sanctuary. The drive from Dehradun to Sankri will take
                        you through scenic places like. Kempty waterfalls, Nainbagh, Mussoorie etc. It is surrounded by
                        peaks of Swargrohini and other Greater Himalayan peaks. By the time you reach Sankri the evening
                        skies rise up forming amazing sceneries. A wonderful kickstart for the upcoming trek. Stay in
                        hotels or homestay here.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- <div class="container-fluid ">
                      <img src="img/nag-tibba-day1.jpg" class="ie-img mb-4">
                    </div> -->

                    <div class="single-box"> <span>02</span>

                      <h4>Day 2: Sankri to Seema via Taluka</h4>
                      <p>Have your breakfast and get started for the early morning drive to Taluka. It is where our
                        actual trekking starts. The driveway of 12 km goes by crossing major streams, bamboo, and deodar
                        trees. It is like turning over numerous mountain bends. There is camping near Forest Rest house,
                        in many cases, trekkers camp here also.</p>

                      <p> Start walking from Taluka on a stone way that descends to the river bed. Here onwards the path
                        is along with the Supin river. After crossing 2-3 bridges both wooden and cement the path
                        becomes ascending gradually. After about an hour open grounds will be seen on the left. You can
                        find many locals busy with their work around here. They greet with happy faces. Another 2 hours
                        walk and you will find beautiful unseen wooden architecture. That is Ghangad village. Another
                        20-minute walk to reach the dhaba and water run mill.</p>

                      <p> We continue from here for another hour to reach another camping ground that has a building
                        construction in process. You will spot a wooden bridge that goes to Osla village. If you have
                        heard, Osla is a popular tourist place these days due to its unique wooden houses. Now keep
                        walking under forest cover beside the Supin river for 60 minutes to reach Seema. Keep your eyes
                        wide open in the forests, you can spot Himalayan Monal. Seema is only a camping place, where you
                        can find many trekkers. Stay in tents and relax for the night.</p>
                    </div>
                    <!-- <div class="container-fluid ">
                      <img src="img/nag-tibba-day3.jpg" class="ie-img mb-4">
                    </div> -->

                    <div class="single-box"> <span>03</span>

                      <h4>Day 3: Seema to Rainbasera</h4>
                      <p>Start fresh to reach our first big spot Debshu Bugyal. Begin by walking along the Supin river,
                        again on the left. The trail ascends today and gets steep as you get close to Debshu Bugyal.
                        Once you arrive in Ruinsara Valley there will be boulders on the route. As you keep climbing
                        look behind to get views of the talked about Oslo village.</p>

                      <p> Another 30 minutes of flat walk and Debshu Bugyal begins. The Bugyal is huge pastureland of 2km
                        length, you can rest here for a while. Kala Nag and Black Peak can be seen from the meadows.</p>

                      <p> The path from here suddenly drops until you reach the river bed. The path is filled with stones
                        and is slippery. Again you will cross a bridge here. Observe the wonderful sights around you. To
                        your dismay, the trail has a steep climb from here. The next campsite Rainbasera has only one
                        small hut. Watch the evening sky beside the gushing river. Many trekkers spend the serene moment
                        next to the river bed boulders. Stay in tents.</p>
                    </div>
                    <!-- <div class="container-fluid ">

                    <div class="single-box"> <span>04</span>

                      <h4>Day 4: Rainbasera to Ruinsara Tal</h4>
                      <p>This is an exciting day because the most awaited Ruinsara Lake will be our next camping ground.
                        The trail will be like somewhat a day before. Keep walking for 3-4 hours until you reach the
                        reflecting water body. You will see glaciers at a distance, cross streams, and have all kinds of
                        adventures to reach the lake.</p>
                      <p> The camping place today will be like a dream come true in many terms. It is placed between Supin
                        river and Ruinsara lake, surrounded by meadows with huge snow-capped mountains in the distance.
                        The stunning peaks of the Bandarpoonch range like Bandarpoonch, Kala Nag, and Dhumdhar Khai, and
                        White peak dominate the skies. You can also find the Yamontri temple here. Just walk around and
                        explore the area.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- <div class="container-fluid ">
                      <img src="img/nag-tibba-day3.jpg" class="ie-img mb-4">
                    </div> -->
                    <div class="single-box"> <span>05</span>
                      <h4>Day 5: Ruinsara Tal to Odari</h4>
                      <p>Rejoice a lot today as it will be a short day of only a 4 km walk. The descends towards the
                        Supin river. The trail goes through forests and river crossing. Before arriving at the next
                        meadows the path gets steep again. From the meadows, you can see the higher peaks. This path is
                        like a trailer of what you witnessed in the past few days.</p>

                      <p> Surprisingly, the vegetation henceforth gets sparse ahead. In a kilometer, you will reach Odari.
                        You can find a rock cave near the camping place. Therefore the name, Odari, means cave. It is
                        believed that Bali (brother of Lord Krishna) halted in this cave for a night. Swargrohini 1 & 2
                        can also be seen clearly from here. After lunch, Trek Leader will take some training sessions
                        that will be useful as you move higher.</p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- <div class="container-fluid ">

                    <div class="single-box"> <span>06</span>
                      <h4>Day 6: Odari to Bali col camp</h4>
                      <p>Even though this day seems shorter, it is not easy. There will steep climb on 60 degrees
                        inclined path. It is like a ridge walk with loose rocks and scree. The trail is also laden with
                        stones making it more difficult. Make sure you take enough rest and drink water. The height gain
                        is significant, therefore, take proper precautions to avoid AMS.</p>

                      <p> The temperatures at night tend to go below sub-zero degrees. It is recommended to be prepared
                        for the cold. After the strainful, rest in tents.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="single-box"> <span>07</span>
                      <h4>Day 7: Bali col cmap to Lower Dhamni via Bali Pass</h4>
                      <p>You can consider this as the summit day. Today you will be crossing the Bali Pass to reach
                        Lower Dhamni. Eat full for sufficient energy for a long day. The trail to Bali pass is steep and
                        has lots of snow. There follow the path broken by your guides only. There is no need for roping
                        up but wear microspikes if required.</p>

                      <p> After a steep climb of 2-3 hours, you will reach the top of the pass. The pass is only 10 feet
                        wide and 30 feet wide. The pass is the high point you will feel like standing on a mountaintop.
                        Relish the 360-degree view of Swargarohini, Banderpooch, and Garhwal peaks. Enjoy the views of
                        Yamnotri valley on the right. Make the most of the sights and the moment. Hold your breath for
                        the descent, because the actual thrill will begin now.</p>

                      <p> The climbing down is almost 90 degrees with a narrow path. Use proper techniques and follow your
                        guide carefully. Even after the leg section, until upper Dhamni the path is extremely tricky so
                        be careful. It may also be strainful due to snow. After this challenging part, rest at Upper
                        Dhamni. The path from leg to Dhamni is confusing, like a maze therefore, make sure to be in a
                        team and follow your guide.</p>

                      </p> After taking a rest, we will resume our trek to Lower Dhamni. The path is a confusing one and
                        therefore it is advised to stay with your trek leader and team. The trail from here will be flat
                        and visible. The path is through the forest and is 2-3 km long. Rest in your tents. This will
                        last stay in tents.</p>

                      <p>The last day of the trek has finally arrived. This will be the easiest day filled with a lot of
                        descends and mild ascend. The trail is a well-paved cement pathway. There is a slight ascend to
                        Yamunotri which may take another 1-2 hours. Leave early from the campsite to reach Dehradun.</p>

                        the climb is steep and depending upon the snow conditions then, we will pick the best route −
                        and it will take about 3−4 hours. As for the view from the top − you will be able to see all the
                        mountains of the Yumnotri, Gangotri and the to Juda−ka−Talab or an alternate campsite, depending
                        on which route we choose. Overnight in tents.</p>
