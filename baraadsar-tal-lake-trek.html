                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The Baraadsar Lake is a sacred lake that lies on the border of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh tucked between the Rupin and Supin valleys in the Western Garhwal Himalayas. The trail to Baradsaar Lake takes you through picturesque meadows, brown oak, and pine forests, massive clearings with breathtaking mountain views, and finally over a ridge that separates the Rupin and Supin valleys with excellent panoramic views. Tucked away inside a massive cauldron, this bowl-shaped high-altitude Baraadsar Lake has high ridges converging from all sides making it one of the least explored treks in the area. The ultimate thrill is a rewarding summit push to reach the lake which makes it a unique trek. This trek is meant for trekkers with previous trekking experience. This moderate-level trek involves a good fitness level due to a series of ascents. Trek this offbeat trail to enjoy unimaginable vistas and stunning sceneries. Pre-monsoon months of mid-May and June and the post-monsoon months of September and October is the best time to do this trek.

                                    <p>The day starts with a 3 hrs drive from the Sankri village to the starting point of this trek, a very beautiful village named Pithari. It is one of the oldest villages in that region where the houses are wonderfully crafted of pine wood, this ancient village represents the rich and colorful culture of this part of the country. The trail cuts through small bushes on a slope with spectacular views of the massive open valley to the right till you reach the first campsite named Barthatra Thatch. The first day of the trek is pretty decent in terms of difficulty, there are no steep ascends. But the major highlight of the day is the Barthatra campsite. Thatch is the local language for clearings of open grounds surrounded by forest. The campsite is a meadow, meaning huge grasslands which are especially famous in this region of the Himalayas. The campsite is surrounded by oak trees on the upper side of the slope. This is a wonderful campsite to explore around. Post Monsoon there is a spot that forms a small Lake surrounded by oak trees making it very pretty. Retire for the night in tents.</p>

                                    <p> Today’s trail is a continuous ascent of 2000 feet till you enter a clearing which is almost half of the trek. The initial part of the trail takes you through the open fields with mesmerizing views of the other side of the valley. The initial portion of the trail takes you through a sudden Oak forest which stays for a good amount of time with the trail cutting through in a zigzag way. A couple of clearings in the middle of the forest is a visual treat since you get to see the unobstructed views of the snowcapped mountains. This view comes off as a pleasant surprise, it will keep you craving for more and all the exhaustion of continuous ascend will go away. When the oak forest ends, it opens up so huge that one can get first glimpses of the Baraadsar peak along with the snow-capped peaks from the left. One can spot Swargarohini massif, Black Peak, and many more unnamed peaks. With the last portion of the trails to Dhaldhar Meadows, the ascent is filled with small rhododendron trees on both sides of the trail, if the season is right you will get to see white, and violet color flowers bloomed in full form which makes it an enchanting experience altogether. The glorious campsite of Dhaldhar is basically on flat ground at the edge of a ridge. The campsite is a giant meadow to the right of which with a carpet of grass layered on waves of land. Rest for the night as the upcoming days will be filled with wonders that await you on the trail. Overnight in tents.</p>

                                    <p>On this particular day the major highlight of this trek is the neverending ridge walk. Once you leave the Dhaldhar campsite after a brief walk you are straight away greeted with wonders of walking on a little narrow ridge which stays until you reach your next campsite which is Devbasa. It is pretty decent in terms of difficulty but as you will be walking over 3500M the Altitude gain factor should not be taken easy. The views are spectacular as on one side you can see the snowcapped mountains and on the other, you can see the giant valleys covered with lush green meadows. You can spot the trail which leads to the giant Baraadsar Peak. There are some sections in which you have to make sure to not get carried away with spectacular views, the trails are pretty narrow on ridges. The magnificent campsite of Devbasa is undoubtedly the best among all the campsites on this trek. The Baraadsar peak is right In front of you standing strong as it gives you a hint of the challenge which lies ahead, one can notice the summit trail from the campsite itself so it will be an awe-inspiring view right In front of you. Make sure you sleep early as you will have to wake up early to attempt the thrilling summit push that awaits the next day. Overnight in tents. </p>

                                    <p> This is the day you have been waiting for all this while on the trek, witnessing the wonder of Baraadsar Lake. So, wake up early around midway in the night, and gear up for the summit push. The trail is a steep ascend to the summit. When the daylight starts hitting the land you will get glorious views of the first rays of the Sun falling on the peaks which will be visible as you gain altitude. Within a few hours you will be gaining over 800 meters which is not a matter of joke at all but the more you gain, the more you get rewarded with views and the surroundings. Towards the summit first comes a bit of a col which is not huge, secondly, there is a small section that resembles a bit of a shoulder which are the biggest highlights of this trek. Just before you reach the Baraadsar top you will have to trace a steep gully which is extremely adventurous. The summit reveals a trail to the Baraadsar pass. During pre – Monsoon months one must have technical knowledge or assistance to reach the final Baraadsar ridge which will eventually take you to the enchanting lake. Spend some time beside the lake, it is a giant one and the color will mesmerize you all the way. By late afternoon come back to camp and it is advisable to take a rest in this camp itself and not to descend. Overnight in the tent..</p>

                                    <p>Distance-wise it is the longest day of all, but hold on if you think you had enough of this trek. This whole trek is Y shaped, which means there is a crossing point where you get down to the opposite side of the slope/ridge. Till the time you reach the merging point where the trail deviates to another point, there are some gradual ascends but not steep. The trail deviates from a grass-covered dome-shaped hill. The gradually ascend ends at a point named Vijay top, a good resting point with a wonderful view of the forest which you are about to enter after you are finally done with the meadows. Halfway through the trek, you will be entering a thick section of oak forest with a complete descent to the next campsite. The forest is pretty dense and there are some sections that can be tricky because some portions are completely covered under dry oak leaves. With a steep descent, you will reach the last campsite, Vasaped which is a clearing but different from the very first campsite. Retire for the night. Overnight in tents.</p>

                                    <p>DThe very last day of the trek goes through a very quiet forest which is a combination of oak and pine, for bird lovers this section will be paradise. One can witness some very recognizable birds of the Himalayan region like Long tail Magpie, Himalayan Thrush, and many more. Right after you come out of the forest halfway through the trek, you are suddenly greeted with some very small Hamlets where the villagers are engaged in their farms for farming. At the far end, the Baraadsar peak will be visible wishing you a happy farewell before it vanishes on the horizon. Just before you reach your end point of the trek you will come across a small yet very charming Lake named Saaru Taal. You can spend some time here and reflect on the humongous journey you had for the past 5 days. The trail ends at Bhitri where the road head starts. Don’t miss out on the chance to visit the village temple. Spend the night in homestays..</p>
